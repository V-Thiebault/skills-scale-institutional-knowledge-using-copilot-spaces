# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team (include Scrum Master for Agile facilitation)
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (Product Manager leads, UX Designer contributes user flows)
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points, facilitated by Scrum Master)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD) - include design review sign-off, deployment readiness, and analytics tracking as appropriate
5. Identify dependencies and integration points (DevOps Engineer assesses infrastructure needs)
6. Create release plan and milestone map (Project Manager coordinates, DevOps Engineer inputs on deployment windows)

## Backlog Item Template

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs
