# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation! This README serves as the central entry point for understanding how we plan, deliver, and continuously improve projects. Whether you're onboarding to the team or looking for a specific process guide, this resource will help you quickly locate the information you need and understand our approach to building great products.

## Summary of Project Management Processes

OctoAcme follows a customer-first, iterative, and data-informed approach to project management with clearly defined roles, responsibilities, and artifacts at every stage of delivery. Our framework emphasizes psychological safety, continuous improvement, and measurable outcomes. Projects move through a structured lifecycle beginning with **initiation**, where we validate business needs, identify stakeholders, and define success criteria through a lightweight Project One-pager. This phase ensures alignment on problem statements, timelines, and resource requirements before committing to detailed planning.

During the **planning and execution** phases, teams break work into shippable increments with clear acceptance criteria and Definition of Done standards. We use project boards (such as GitHub Projects) to track progress from backlog to completion, supported by daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, and regular demos. Quality assurance is embedded throughout execution with unit tests, integration tests, security scanning, and manual QA as needed. The Project Manager coordinates schedules, dependencies, and risk management while the Product Manager owns the backlog prioritization and success metrics. Developers implement features collaboratively, and QA/Testing validates that acceptance criteria are met before release.

**Risk management and communication** are integral to our process. Teams maintain a living Risk Register that tracks impact, likelihood, ownership, and mitigation plans for identified risks. Stakeholder communication follows regular cadences—weekly PM/Product Lead syncs, twice-weekly standups, and monthly stakeholder updates—with escalation paths defined for team-level, product-level, and sponsor-level issues. Clear communication templates ensure consistency in status reporting and incident response.

Our **release and deployment** practices prioritize automation, observability, and safety. Every release requires passing CI tests, security scans, drafted release notes, and a documented rollback plan. We deploy to staging first for smoke testing before production releases, and maintain incident response playbooks for quick mitigation if issues arise. After each sprint, release, or milestone, we conduct **retrospectives** to capture what went well, identify improvement opportunities, and define 2-3 actionable items with clear owners and timelines. This continuous feedback loop ensures that lessons learned translate into tangible process improvements, creating a culture of learning and iterative enhancement.
